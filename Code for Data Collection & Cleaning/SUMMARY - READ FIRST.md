# Code for Data Collection & Cleaning

## What's going on here? 

In this folder, there will be a number of .py files that contain certain functions that were written to access data, clean it, and export it back to an excel file.
Each function writes the data to a Pandas dataframe; this is so all the data can be later aggregated into one dataframe for analysis. As per this project's requirements, 
we gather data from one government resource (the US Census Bureau) and 3 web sources. More information will be provided below:
